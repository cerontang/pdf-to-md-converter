4.1.1.5 The design of reinforced soil retaining walls and abutments should conform to BS 8006-1:2010, Section 6.

#### Gravity retaining walls 4.1.2

The design of gravity retaining walls should conform to 4.1.1.1 and Clause 5.

Gravity retaining walls are earth retaining structures that depend primarily NOTE on their own self-weight (and that of any enclosed material) to support the retained ground and any structures or loads placed upon it.

#### Semi-gravity retaining walls 4.1.3

The design of semi-gravity retaining walls should conform to 4.1.1.1 and Clause 6.

NOTE Semi-qravity retaining walls are earth retaining structures that depend partly on their own self-weight (and that of any enclosed material) and partly on their structural resistance to support the retained ground and any structures or loads placed upon it.

#### Embedded retaining walls 4.1.4

The design of embedded retaining walls should conform to 4.1.1.1 and Clause 7.

NOTE Embedded retaining walls are earth retaining structures that depend primarily on lateral earth resistance and their own structural resistance (plus that of any structural supports) to support the retained ground and any structures or loads placed upon it.

#### Cofferdams 4.1.5

The design of cofferdams should conform to 4.1.1.1 and Clause 8.

NOTE Cofferdams are composite earth retaining structures that act in some ways like a gravity retaining wall and in other ways like an embedded retaining wall.

#### 4.2.1 Design requirements

#### 4.2.1.1 Geotechnical data and investigation

4.2.1.1.1 Geotechnical data should be obtained in accordance with BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, Clause 3.

4.2.1.1.2 Particular attention should be given to the requirements of BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 3.1.

4.2.1.1.3 Geotechnical investigations should conform to BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 3.2.

4.2.1.1.4 Ground investigations should conform to BS EN 1997-2 and BS 5930. Information about the site from the desk study should be used to supplement that obtained in any new ground investigation.

4.2.1.1.5 Sampling and testing of contaminated ground and groundwater should conform to BS 10175 and BS ISO 5667-11.

4.2.1.1.6 The spacing and depth of site investigations for earth retaining structures should conform to BS EN 1997-2:2007, B.3, and this subclause (4.2.1).

4.2.1.1.7 The location of investigation points for an earth retaining structure should be representative of the line of the structure and should encompass both the retained and the retaining material. The number of investigation points should be sufficient to establish ground conditions, and any variability in those conditions, along the length of the earth retaining structure.

4.2.1.1.8 The spacing of investigation points along the length of an earth retaining structure should be no greater than 20 m, unless the ground conditions can be shown to be sufficiently uniform to justify a greater spacing.

4.2.1.1.9 For gravity and semi-gravity earth retaining structures, the depth of investigation below the planned base of the foundation (z¸) should conform to recommendations given in BS 8004:2015, 4.2.1.1, for low-rise buildings, namely:

$$z_{a} \geq \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 2b_{f} \\ 3m \end{array} \right. \tag{1}$$

where:

is the smaller side length of the wall's foundation (on plan). bf

4.2.1.1.10 For embedded earth retaining structures, the depth of investigation below the base of the excavation (z ) should satisfy:

 
$$z_{a} \ge \begin{cases} 2H & \text{for an unsupported structure} \\ H + 2 & \text{for a supported structure} \end{cases} $$
 
$$(2)$$

where:

H is the retained height.

4.2.1.1.11 If ground anchors are proposed to support an embedded retaining wall, the investigation should be of sufficient depth and lateral extent to provide data on the ground in which the anchors attain their bond lengths in accordance with BS 8081.

4.2.1.1.12 The presence of trees and large shrubs should be recorded during the course of the ground investigation, so that decisions can be taken concerning their retention or subsequent removal.

Guidance on site investigation can be found in the ICE manual of NOTE geotechnical engineering (2012), Volume I, Section 4: Site investigation [3] and in the NHBC Design Guide, Efficient design of piled foundations for low rise housing (2010), Section 4: Site investigation [5].

#### Design situations 4.2.2

4.2.2.1 Design situations should be specified in accordance with BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 2.2.

4.2.2.2 Design situations for earth retaining structures should include:

- the conditions given in BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 9.3.3; .
- the geometry of the structure and neighbouring ground;
- . material characteristics of the structure, e.g. following corrosion;
- effects due to the environment within which the design is set;
- . qroundwater levels, including their variations due to the effects of dewatering, possible flooding, or failure of any drainage system;
- overdredging of river or sea beds;
- deepening of river or sea beds due to scour;
- increase in hydrostatic head due to drawdown; and
- water levels in the tidal or flood range.

To conform to BS EN 1990, exceptional conditions involving local failure (such as a burst water pipe that continues to leak after the burst) should be classified as accidental design situations.

#### 4.2.3 Design considerations

### COMMENTARY ON 4.2.3

Design and construction considerations for earth retaining structures are given in BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 9.4.1. The design considerations given in this subclause also include more specific examples of the issues that can affect the performance of earth retaining structures.

#### 4.2.3.1 General

The design of an earth retaining structure should consider:

- the design considerations given in BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 9.4.1; .
- the influence of tidal and flood conditions on groundwater, both for waterfront structures and also for near-shore structures;
- the maximum tidal and flood range to waterfront structures; ●
- potential or possible surge tides and flood conditions;
- the height, length and angle of approach of waves, and the resulting forces ● on the structure;
- softening and subsequent loss of strength of fine-grained backfill behind the retaining structure;
- softening and subsequent loss of strength of fine soil beneath formation level in front of the retaining structure;
- . ingress of water into fissures formed during hot, dry spells;

- the effect of frost action behind the structure;
- . the effect on the earth pressures acting against the structure owing to climatic variations, including:
	- . diurnal and seasonal temperature changes (particularly ground freezing):
	- short- and long-term rainfall variations and resulting moisture content . changes in the ground;
	- artificially induced climatic changes such as those produced in boiler . houses or cold stores;
- trafficking by heavy plant; ●
- seepage flow around the structure, taking into account layers of markedly different permeability; and
- the possibility that the level of any compacted fill placed against the back of ● an earth retaining structure might differ during construction from the level of any adjoining fill.

#### 4.2.3.2 Drainage

### COMMENTARY ON 4.2.3.2

Provision of suitable drainage is vital to ensure the acceptable performance of an earth retaining structure. Groundwater control is separate from the control of surface water, such as rainfall run-off.

4.2.3.2.1 Drainage should be provided to prevent:

- surface water from entering and eroding the face of any excavations; o
- build-up of excessive water pressures during construction in case they have harmful effects upon the foundations;
- instability of slopes.

4.2.3.2.2 Measures taken to prevent groundwater entering a structure should conform to BS 8102. Alternatively, a properly designed and ventilated air space may be provided.

4.2.3.2.3 Sub-surface drainage used to lessen the risk of water ingress into a structure should be designed in accordance with BS 8102.

4.2.3.2.4 Surface water drains should be constructed using one of the types of pipe listed in 4.3.10.

4.2.3.2.5 Drainage systems should be designed for ease of maintenance and renewal during the design working life of the structure.

4.2.3.2.6 Where the safety and serviceability of the works depend on the successful performance of the drainage system, the consequences of failure should be considered and one of the following conditions (or a combination of them) should be applied:

- a maintenance programme specified;
- a drainage system specified that will perform adequately without ● maintenance; or
- . . a secondary ("backup") system specified – for example, a pipe or channel that encloses the primary system – that will prevent any potential leakage from entering the ground beneath or next to the structure.

4.2.3.2.7 The design of drainage systems for earth retaining structures should consider:

- the design considerations given in BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 9.4.2;
- . changes in groundwater levels (temporary or permanent) owing to construction of the structure.

4.2.3.2.8 A drainage layer might be required to prevent one or more of the phenomena listed in 4.2.3.2.1. Wherever practical, a structure that retains cohesive soil or backfill of medium to low permeability (2 × 10-5 m/s or less) should be provided with a drainage laver at its back face.

4.2.3.2.9 Drainage layers may be constructed from:

- . a blanket of rubble or coarse aggregate, clean gravel, or crushed stone;
- hand-placed pervious blocks as dry walling;
- a graded filter drain, where the backfilling consists of fine-grain material;
- a geotextile filter, in combination with a permeable granular material; or
- . a qeotextile composite (fin-drain), consisting of a geotextile filter fixed to one or both faces of a permeable core.

4.2.3.2.10 The design of filters should conform to CIRIA C750 (2015), Section 3.3 [N1].

4.2.3.2.11 A drainage system should be designed so that water freely exits from drainage layers, through porous land drains or pipes laid at the bottom of the drainage layers, or through weepholes.

4.2.3.2.12 Any impermeable wall or facing should have weepholes provided " unless an alternative drainage system is provided or they are designed to resist the water pressure.

Guidance on surface water control can be found in Groundwater lowering NOTE 1 in contruction: a practical guide [6], Construction dewatering and groundwater control: new methods and applications [7], and CIRIA C750 [N1].

Guidance on groundwater control can be found in the ICE manual of NOTE 2 geotechnical engineering (2012), Volume II, Chapter 80 [1].

#### 4.2.3.3 Cyclic loading

The following should be taken into account during the design of earth retaining structures subject to cyclic loading:

- . degradation of ground strength (leading to ultimate limit states being exceeded at loads below those expected from verifications based on static strength);
- degradation of ground stiffness, leading to an accumulation of permanent foundation displacement ("ratcheting" effects); and
- amplification of loads or movements owing to resonance. ●

Guidance on foundations subjected to cyclic and dynamic loads can be NOTE found in the ICE manual of geotechnical engineering (2012), Volume II, Chapter 60 [1].

#### 4.2.3.4 Trees

COMMENTARY ON 4.2.3.4

Earth retaining structures built adjacent to existing trees might suffer deleterious effects from the penetration of root-systems. These effects include increased loading on the structure and penetration of roots into joints or drainage systems.

12 © The British Standards Institution 2015 .

4.2.3.4.1 The principles and procedures to be applied to achieve a harmonious and sustainable relationship between trees (including shrubs and hedges) and structures should conform to BS 5837.

4.2.3.4.2 Earth retaining structures should be designed to accommodate any volumetric changes in clay soils that might be caused by the presence of nearby trees.

NOTE Guidance on building near trees can be found in NHBC Standards, Chapter 4.2 [8].

#### 4.2.3.5 Environmental considerations

The following should be taken into account during the design of earth retaining structures:

- their effect on sensitive species;
- generation and control of noise and dust during construction;
- generation, reuse and disposal of waste materials;
- minimizing the amount of material to be disposed of; ●
- contaminants entering watercourses (for example, as a result of excavation); ●
- reuse of clayey soils and weak rocks (such as marls and shales) might require ● particular attention and expedients, including treatment with cement;
- management of water on site;
- . stability of earthworks;
- generation and control of contaminated run-off;
- managing vegetation, especially the risks associated with allowing vegetation to grow unchecked; and
- o the carbon footprint of the construction and the use of the structure.

#### 4.2.3.6 Ground improvement

Guidance on ground improvement can be found in BS 8004.

#### Materials 4.3

For quidance on specific formations (e.g. London clay, Lambeth group, glacial NOTE soils and tills, problematic soils, chalk and Mercia mudstone group), see Annex B.

#### Soils 4.3.1

#### 4.3.1.1 General

COMMENTARY ON 4.3.1.1

The design of earth retaining structures usually involves effective stress analysis, although, in some circumstances ,total stress analysis might be appropriate or necessary for the design of foundations in fine soils. Soil properties are determined as part of the site investigation process but might be supplemented by data from back analysis of comparable earth retaining structures in similar ground conditions.

4.3.1.1.1 The identification and description of soil should conform to BS EN ISO 14688-1.

4.3.1.1.2 The classification of soil should conform to BS EN ISO 14688-2.

4.3.1.1.3 Soil properties should be determined in accordance with BS EN 1997-2 and BS 5930.

.*

4.3.1.1.4 Characteristic soil parameters should be selected in accordance with BS EN 1997-1, based on the results of field and laboratory tests, complemented by well-established experience.

NOTE 1 Guidance on soil description can be found in Soil and rock description in engineering practice [9].

NOTE 2 Information about the behaviour of soils as particulate materials can be found in the ICE manual of geotechnical engineering (2012), Volume I, Chapter 14 [3].

#### Very coarse soils (cobbles and boulders) 4.3.1.2

COMMENTARY ON 4.3.1.2

Very coarse soils contain a majority (by weight) of particles >63 mm in size. Cobbles are between 63 mm and 200 mm in size; boulders are qreater than 200 mm.

Very coarse soils should be identified and classified in accordance with BS EN ISO 14688 and BS 5930.

#### 4.3.1.3 Coarse soils (sands and gravels)

COMMENTARY ON 4.3.1.3

Coarse soils contain a majority (by weight) of particles ≤63 mm in size and do not stick together when wet. Sand particles are between 0.063 mm and 2 mm in size; gravels are between 2 mm and 63 mm. Coarse soils cannot be remoulded.

4.3.1.3.1 When establishing the values of parameters for coarse soils, the following should be considered:

- . the items listed in BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 2.4.3(5);
- the weakening of collapsible soils above the groundwater table, owing to percolation or a rise in groundwater levels;
- disturbance of dense deposits owing to unsuitable construction methods; and
- . the presence of weaker material.

4.3.1.3.2 For coarse soils above the groundwater table, the suggested values for characteristic weight density given in Figure 1 may be used in the absence of reliable test results.

4.3.1.3.3 For coarse soils below the groundwater table, the suggested values for characteristic weight density given in Figure 2 may be used in the absence of reliable test results.

4.3.1.3.4 A superior value of weight density should be selected when a high value is unfavourable; an inferior value should be selected when a low value is unfavourable.

4.3.1.3.5 For siliceous sands and gravels, the characteristic constant volume (also known as critical state) effective angle of shearing resistance (ø 'y) may – in the absence of reliable test results - be estimated from:

$$\varphi^{\prime}_{cv,k} = 30^{\circ} + \varphi^{\prime}_{ang} + \varphi^{\prime}_{PSD}\tag{3}$$

where:

4.3.1.3.6 For siliceous sands and gravels with a fines content less than 15%, the characteristic peak effective angle of shearing resistance ($\phi'_{pk,k}$) may be estimated from:

$$
\varphi^{\\'}_{pk,k} = \varphi^{\\'}_{cv,k} + \varphi^{\\'}_{dil}
\tag{4}
$$

where:

$\phi_{dil}^{\prime}$ is contribution to $\phi_{pk}^{\prime}$ from soil dilatancy. dil

Values of ø'gil are given in Table 1.

4.3.1.3.7 The value of ø ;;; may alternatively be estimated from:

$$\varphi^{\prime}_{\rm di} = n_{R} = n \big| \, l_{D} \times \ln \big( \sigma_{c} / \sigma^{\prime}_{f} \big) - 1 \big| \tag{5}$$

where:

| n     | is 3 for triaxial strain or 5 for plane strain; |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------|
| $I_R$ | is the soil's relative dilatancy index;         |

เร the sours aensity เทลี่ยม (ติดตาร์ต เทค หวัง หมาย 14688-2); 'D

is the aggregate crushing stress; and のこ

σ'<sub>f</sub> is mean effective stress in the soil at peak strength.

NOTE 1 Bolton [11] defines the relative dilatancy index as I = I (Q - I , p ') - 1, where Q = In o and p' = o' ;

NOTE 2 Many geotechnical problems can be simplified into a two-dimensional form where the foundation or structure is significantly long in one direction in comparison with other dimensions. Hence, a large number of stability problems involving embankments and cuttings, retaining walls and strip footings are commonly analysed by assuming a plane strain condition in which no deformation occurs in the direction of the long dimension of the foundation or structure.

4.3.1.3.8 The value of of may be taken as 20 MPa for quartz sands, but can be substantially larger for quartz silts, and substantially smaller for carbonate sands (see The strength and dilatancy of sands [11]).

4.3.1.3.9 If the fines content of the coarse soil exceeds 25%, then ø'aj should be assumed to be zero, unless testing demonstrates otherwise. For coarse soils with fines content between 15% and 25%, φ' and may be determined by linear interpolation.

4.3.1.3.10 If shearing is matrix (i.e. fines) controlled, then ø'ang should be assumed to be zero, unless testing demonstrates otherwise. For coarse soils with fines content between 15% and 25%, ø'ang may be determined by linear interpolation.

4.3.1.3.11 The characteristic angle of shearing resistance (ø' ) for coarse soils with fines content exceeding 25% should be determined as for fine soils (see 4.3.1.4).

#### Fine soils (silts and clays) 4.3.1.4

# COMMENTARY ON 4.3.1.4

Fine soils contain a majority (by weight) of particles ≤63 mm in size and stick together when wet. Silt particles are between 0.002 mm and 0.063 mm in size; clay particles are smaller than 0.002 mm. Fine soils can be remoulded.

Clay soils with plasticity indices greater than about 20% might exhibit considerably lower angles of shearing resistance than observed at the critical state, if their particles become fully aligned with one another. This phenomenon is termed "sliding shear" to distinguish it from "rolling shear" observed in other soils (including coarse soils and fine soils with plasticity indices less than 20%). The angle of shearing resistance exhibited during sliding shear is called the "residual angle of shearing resistance".

4.3.1.4.1 When establishing the values of parameters for fine soils, the following should be considered, as a minimum:

- . the items listed in BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 2.4.3(5);
- . pre-existing slip surfaces;
- dessication; and ●
- . any changes in stress state, either induced by construction or resulting from the final design condition.

4.3.1.4.2 For fine soils above the groundwater table, the suggested values for characteristic weight density given in Figure 1 may be used in the absence of reliable test results.

4.3.1.4.3 For fine soils below the groundwater table, the suggested values for characteristic weight density given in Figure 2 may be used in the absence of reliable test results.

4.3.1.4.4 A superior value of weight density should be selected when a high value is unfavourable; an inferior value should be selected when a low value is unfavourable.

4.3.1.4.5 In the absence of reliable test data, the characteristic undrained shear strength of a fine soil ($c_{uk}$) may be estimated from:

$$\frac{C_{u,k}}{\rho_{v}^{\prime}} = k_{1}R_{O}^{k_{2}} = k_{1}\left(\frac{\rho_{v,max}^{\prime}}{\rho_{v}^{\prime}}\right)^{k_{2}\tag{6}}$$

where:

p'v is the effective overburden pressure in the ground; p'v

p'v,max is the maximum effective overburden pressure that the soil has previously been subjected to;

Ro is the soil's overconsolidation ratio; and Ro

k1 and k2 are constants.

The ratio c Jp' , normally varies with depth (i.e. it is not a constant). NOTE

4.3.1.4.6 In the absence of reliable test data, the values of k, and k, in equation (6) may be taken as 0.23 ±0.04 and 0.8 respectively (following New developments in field and laboratory testing of soils [12]).

4.3.1.4.7 When determining the characteristic undrained strength of high strength fine soils, due allowance should be made for:

- . the detrimental effect of any sand or silt partings containing free groundwater;
- the influence of sampling;
- the influence of the method of testing; and
- likely softening on excavation.

4.3.1.4.8 For fine soils, the characteristic constant volume (also known as critical state) effective angle of shearing resistance (φ λλλ may, in the absence of reliable test results, be estimated from:

$$\varphi^{\\'}_{cv,k} = (42^{\circ} - 12.5\log_{10}l_p) \quad \text{for} \quad 5\% \le l_p \le 100\% \tag{7}$$

where:

Ip is the soil's plasticity index (entered as a %). lp

NOTE 1 Equation (7) is based on an expression proposed by Santamarina and Díaz-Rodriguez [13]_which fits data presented by Terzaghi, Peck, and Mesri [14].

NOTE Values of ø'ç in excess of 40° have been observed for clays that classify as highly plastic but show signs of bioturbation or the presence of microfossils.

4.3.1.4.9 The characteristic constant volume effective cohesion (c^^) should be taken as zero.

4.3.1.4.10 The peak effective angle of shearing resistance (المهم) may be related to the constant volume effective angle of shearing resistance (ø ~,) by:

$$
\varphi'_{pk} = \varphi'_{cv} + \varphi'_{dl} \tag{8}
$$

where:

φ'<sub>cv</sub> is the soil's constant-volume angle of shearing resistance; and

φ'dil is the contribution to φ'pk,k from soil dilatancy. 

NOTE 1 The value of ø' "for fine soils is not the same as that for coarse soils. For fine soils, it is typically in the range of 0°-4°. No specific guidance is given in this standard for values of φ' aij for fine soils.

Values of ø'y, are known to increase with a fine soil's overconsolidation NOTE 2 ratio and are greater than or equal to zero.

4.3.1.4.11 When a clay soil is able to undergo "sliding shear" – normally only where pre-existing slip surfaces exist in the ground - then the operational angle of shearing resistance is the clay's residual value (ø' ) .

$$
\varphi^{\\'}_{\rm res} \leq \varphi^{\\'}_{\rm cv} \leq \varphi^{\\'}_{\rm pk} \tag{9}
$$

where:

is the soil's constant-volume angle of shearing resistance; and φ cv

is the soil's peak angle of shearing resistance. φ pk

#### 4.3.1.5 Mixed soils

COMMENTARY ON 4.3.1.5

Some deposits (especially glacial deposits) can comprise a mixture of fine and coarse soils, e.g. sandy clays and clayey sands. The behaviour of mixed soils is typically intermediate between that of coarse and fine soils.

For mixed soils with clay fraction less than 50% (plasticity index less than 30% or liquid limit less than 60%), o ' x may, in the absence of reliable test data, be estimated from Drained shear strength parameters for analysis of landslides [15].

#### 4.3.1.6 Soil stiffness

COMMENTARY ON 4.3.1.6

Young's modulus of elasticity of an isotropic soil (E) is related to its shear modulus (G) by:

$$E = 2G(1 + v)\tag{10}$$

where:

- is the soil's Poisson's ratio. v
Stiffness parameters for a soil depend on the level of strain (axial ঃ or engineering shear strain γ) applied to the soil, as illustrated in Figure 3:

- at very small strains (ε or γ ≤ ~ 0.001 %), the soil's moduli of elasticity (E and G) ● reach their maximum values (Emax and Gmax), also known as "very-small-strain" values; Emax and Gmax are normally measured using dynamic methods, such as laboratory tests using bender-elements or field tests using seismic methods;
- at small strains (0.001 % ≤ ε οι γ ≤ 0.1%), E and G decrease rapidly with increasing strain, as shown in Figure 3; their values are measured using advanced methods, such as laboratory tests with local gauges;
- tangent values of small-strain stiffness (Eran and Gran) are commonly used in ● numerical methods of design;
- at large strains (દ or y > 0.1%), E and G decrease less rapidly with increasing strain and are commonly taken to be constant in value; those values are measured using conventional laboratory testing;
- secant values of large-strain stiffness (E & and G & B are commonly used in ● routine methods of design;
- soil stiffness parameters are not normally isotropic. Simple isotropic models are ● to be used with caution, especially if their adequacy has not been demonstrated by back analysis. Depending on the soil's deposition history, different values of stiffness might be appropriate for vertical strains (E.) compared to horizontal strains (En) and for shearing in different directions (GBK Gn).

4.3.1.6.2 The secant shear modulus of a soil, G gee, may be estimated from (see also Stiffness of sands through a laboratory database [17]):

$$\frac{G_{\rm sec}}{G_{\rm max}} = \left[1 + \left(\frac{\gamma - \gamma_{\rm e}}{\gamma_{\rm ref}}\right)^{m}\right]^{-1} \le 1\tag{11}$$

where:

Gmax is the soil's very-small-strain shear modulus;

γ is the engineering shear strain in the soil; y

- is the elastic threshold strain beyond which shear modulus falls Ve below its maximum value;
- is a reference value of engineering shear strain (at which Vref GsedGmax = 0.5); and
- is a coefficient that depends on soil type. m

#### Rocks and rock masses 4.3.2

### COMMENTARY ON 4.3.2

The engineering properties of rock relevant in design are controlled by the extent and orientation of the bedding planes and joints within the rock mass, together with the water pressures on the discontinuity planes. The site investigation needs to establish the strength and orientation of the discontinuity planes.

Weak rocks, particularly weakly cemented sandstones, fissured shales and chalk, are often difficult materials to sample and test.

4.3.2.1 The identification and classification of rock should conform to BS EN ISO 14689-1.

4.3.2.2 Rock properties should be determined in accordance with BS EN 1997-2 and BS 5930, as well as BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 3.3.2, 3.3.8 and 3.3.9.

4.3.2.3 Characteristic rock parameters for intact rock should be selected in accordance with BS EN 1997-1, based on the results of field and laboratory tests, complemented by well-established experience.

4.3.2.4 Design parameters for the rock mass should take into account the properties of the intact rock and any discontinuities. See BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 3.3.8.

4.3.2.5 The following non-destructive tests may be used to determine rock mineralogy and composition in order to predict the rock's performance during excavation (in particular, if it will slurry or smear rather than be broken up into smaller pieces):

- microscope;
- X-ray computerized tomography; and
- spectroscopy.

#### Fill 4.3.3

COMMENTARY ON 4.3.3

The term "fill" refers to artificially deposited material, for example, in an excavation or as ground made by human activity. These materials are also termed "artificial ground".

"Non-engineered" fill is material that is dumped with little control and in deep lifts. It is often poorly compacted, and thus in a loose state, and has varying geotechnical properties, both horizontally and vertically. Non-engineered fill is commonly referred to as "made ground".

"Engineered" fill is material that is placed with some degree of control to ensure that its geotechnical properties conform to a predetermined specification. Engineered fill is commonly referred to as just "fill".

On geological maps, "made ground" refers to material placed above and "fill" to material placed below original ground level. On recent British Geological Survey (BGS) maps, these terms have been altered to "made up ground" and "infilled ground".

4.3.3.1 All materials intended to be placed behind earth retaining structures should be properly investigated and classified.

4.3.3.2 Non-engineered fill, such as industrial, chemical, and domestic wastes, should not be placed behind earth retaining structures.

4.3.3.3 Engineered fill comprising selected coarse granular soils, such as well-graded small rockfills, gravels, and sands, may be placed behind earth retaining structures.

4.3.3.4 Engineered fill should be appropriate to the intended application. The fill should be classified and an earthworks specification provided detailing acceptability criteria, compliance testing, and compaction requirements. The qeneral specification of earthworks fill should conform to BS 6031.

Guidance on the description of made ground can be found in Soil and rock NOTE 1 description in engineering practice, Chapter 14 [9].

NOTE 2 Information about non-engineered fills can be found in the ICE manual of qeotechnical engineering (2012), Volume I, Chapter 34 [3].

NOTE 3 Information about fill formation and deposits, covering opencast mining backfill, colliery spoil, pulverized fly ash, industrial and chemical wastes, urban fill, domestic refuse, infilled docks, pits, and quaries, and hydraulic fill, can be found in BRE Report 424 (2nd edition), Chapter 2 [22].

#### 4.3.4 Earthworks

The properties of earthworks should be determined in accordance with BS 6031.

#### 4.3.5 Groundwater

4.3.5.1 Groundwater pressures should be determined by considering hydrological, hydrogeological and environmental information.

4.3.5.2 To conform to BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 2.4.6.1(6)P, design values of groundwater pressure at the serviceability limit state should be the most unfavourable values that could occur during normal circumstances.

4.3.5.3 To conform to BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 2.4.6.1(6)P, design values of groundwater pressure at the ultimate limit state should be the most unfavourable values that could occur during the design lifetime of the structure.

NOTE The relationship between characteristic and design water pressures can be determined by applying a geometrical margin.

4.3.5.4 If suitable statistical data are available, then design values of groundwater pressure at the serviceability limit state should be chosen with a return period at least equal to the duration of the design situation, and design values at the ultimate limit state should be chosen such that there is a 1% probability that they are exceeded during the design situation.

4.3.5.5 Where groundwater pressures are not hydrostatic, the design should take into account:

- . the worst credible combination of heterogeneity and anisotropy of permeability;
- effects of layering, fissuring and other heterogeneity;
- any geometrical features that could cause pressures to concentrate (such as in corners of excavations).

4.3.5.6 Long-term changes in groundwater that are likely to occur during the design working life of the structure (including those due to climate change and rising groundwater) should be taken into account.

4.3.5.7 Increased groundwater pressures owing to burst pipes and other failures of enqineered systems should be classified as accidental actions if the event that causes the increase in groundwater pressure is unlikely to occur during the design working life of the structure.

4.3.5.8 The design of an earth retaining structure should be based on the most adverse water pressure conditions that can be anticipated.

NOTE Guidance on the selection of water tables and seepage forces can be found in CIRIA Report C580 [N3].

4.3.5.9 Design water pressures should take into account the effect of tides on water levels in the ground.

NOTE Guidance on tides and water level variations can be found in BS 6349-1-3.

4.3.5.10 If the equilibrium level of the water table is well defined and measures are taken to prevent it changing during heavy rain or flood, the design water pressures can be calculated from the position of the equilibrium water table, making due allowance for possible seasonal variations, otherwise the most adverse water pressure conditions that can be anticipated should be used in design.

4.3.5.11 Equilibrium water levels in fine soils should be determined from piezometric readings taken over an adequate length of time.

4.3.5.12 Allowance should be made in undrained (i.e. total stress) analyses for water pressures due to the temporary filling of cracks in fine soils.

4.3.5.13 Water pressures used in drained (i.e. effective stress) analyses should be determined for the groundwater regime in the vicinity of the structure.

4.3.5.14 Where a difference in water pressures exists on opposite sides of an earth retaining structure, allowance should be made for seepage around the wall. Where layers of markedly different permeability exist, the water levels relevant to each permeable stratum should be taken into account.

4.3.5.15 The distribution of pore water pressures may be determined from a flow net, provided it adequately represents the hydraulic and permeability conditions in the vicinity of the structure.

#### 4.5.1.5 Load models for abutments and walls adjacent to public highways and railways

### COMMENTARY ON 4.5.1.5

BS EN 1991-1-2 defines "Load Model 1" (LM1) for general and local verifications of structures subject to the effects of traffic of lorries and cars. LM1 comprises two components: a tandem system (TS) with two concentrated loads and a uniformly distributed load (UDL).

30 © The British Standards Institution 2015 ●

As suqqested in Note 1 to BS EN 1991-2:2003, Paragraph 4.9.1(1), the tandem system (TS) loads defined in Load Model 1 may be replaced by an equivalent uniformly distributed load (q ~) spread over an appropriate relevant rectangular surface depending on the dispersal of the loads through the backfill or earth. For normal traffic, the UK National Annex to BS EN 1991-2 provides the vehicle model (Figure NA.6) to be used for vertical loads on backfill behind abutments and wingwalls.

The equivalent surcharge values given in this subclause are more onerous than Load Models given in the UK National Annex to BS EN 1991-2, but simpler to apply in design.

4.5.1.5.1 Load models for the design of abutments and wing walls adjacent to road bridges, footbridges, and railway bridges should conform to the UK National Annex to BS EN 1991-2:2003, NA.2.34.

4.5.1.5.2 The characteristic vertical and horizontal pressures in the backfill behind a bridge abutment or winq wall and other horizontal actions on such structures should conform to the UK National Annex to BS EN 1991-2:2003.

4.5.1.5.3 Horizontal earth pressure due to traffic loading behind a bridge abutment or wing wall should additionally conform to PD 6694-1.

4.5.1.5.4 Alternatively, traffic loading behind winq walls and other earth retaining structures may be modelled as a uniformly distributed load conforming to 4.5.1.5.5.

4.5.1.5.5 Where the centre-line of the nearest traffic wheel load is located at least 0.5 m away from the rear face of an earth retaining structure, the load model defined in the UK National Annex to BS EN 1991-2:2003, NA.2.34 may be replaced by a uniformly distributed load (qç) over the entire ground surface from the back of the structure.

4.5.1.5.6 Characteristic values of q , should be taken from Table 7.

4.5.1.5.8 The vertical loading and earth pressure effects of normal traffic on mainline railways may be modelled as a uniformly distributed load over a width of 3 m at a level 0.7 m below the running surface of the track, as detailed in BS EN 1991-2:2003, 6.3.6.4.

#### Earth pressures 4.5.2

#### 4.5.2.1 General

4.5.2.1.1 Earth pressures should be calculated in accordance with BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 9.5.

4.5.2.1.2 For earth retaining structures in rock, the calculation of earth pressures should take into account discontinuities in the rock mass. The rock should be considered to have the potential to fail either as a rock mass or on planes of discontinuity.

NOTE It might be beneficial to seek specialist advice when designing earth retaining structures in rock.

4.5.2.1.3 The model factor on earth pressure coefficients that is recommended in PD 6694-1 should only be applied to gravity and semi-gravity walls that form part of or are adjacent to bridges and are subject to traffic loading.

The purpose of the model factor (75d;k = 1.2) that is recommended in NOTE PD 6694-1 is to maintain a level of reliability similar to that achieved in the withdrawn BS 5400 for the design of steel, concrete, and composite bridges.

#### At-rest earth pressures 4.5.2.2

COMMENTARY ON 4.5.2.2

Where there is no movement of an earth retaining structure relative to the ground acting against it, the retained material is said to be in an "at-rest" state.

At-rest earth pressures should be calculated in accordance with BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 9.5.2.

#### Active earth pressures 4.5.2.3

COMMENTARY ON 4.5.2.3

Where an earth retaining structure moves away from the ground sufficiently for the earth pressure against it to reach its minimum value, the ground is said to be in an "active" state. This condition is mainly relevant to ground located behind the structure (i.e. the retained ground).

4.5.2.3.1 In a drained analysis, when the earth retaining structure moves away from the ground, the effective earth pressure acting normal to the face of the structure (P'¸) may be calculated from:

$$P^{\\'}_{n} \ge P^{\\'}_{a} = K_{a}P^{\\'}_{v} - K_{ac}c^{\\'}
\tag{13}$$

where:

| <i>P'a</i>               | is the effective active earth pressure acting normal to<br>the structure; |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <i>P'</i>                | is the effective overburden pressure in the ground;                       |
| <i>c'</i>                | is the soil's effective cohesion; and                                     |
| <i>Ka</i> and <i>Kac</i> | are active earth pressure coefficients.                                   |

4.5.2.3.2 Values of the active earth pressure coefficient K, may be calculated from the analytical procedure given in BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, C.2.

32 © The British Standards Institution 2015 .

4.5.2.3.3 For earth retaining structures with vertical faces, values of the active earth pressure coefficient, K., may be estimated from the figures given in BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, C.1.

The formulae in BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2014, C.1, give similar values of K, to NOTE BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2014, C.2.

4.5.2.3.4 The value of Kg may be calculated from:

$$K_{ac} = 2\sqrt{K_a(1 + a/c')} \le 2.56\sqrt{K_a} \tag{14}$$

where:

a

- is the effective adhesion at the interface between the soil and structure.
4.5.2.3.5 In an undrained analysis, when the earth retaining structure moves away from the ground, the total pressure acting normal to the face of the structure (pg) may be calculated from:

$$\rho_{\rm n}\geq\rho_{\rm a}=\rho_{\rm v}-K_{\rm ac,u}c_{\rm u}\tag{15}$$

where:

is the total active pressure acting normal to the structure; pa

- is the total overburden pressure in the ground; p,
c<sub>u</sub> is the soil's undrained shear strength; and

Kac,u is an undrained active earth pressure coefficient.

4.5.2.3.6 The value of Kg , may be calculated from:

$$K_{ac,u} = 2\sqrt{1 + a/c_u} \le 2.56 \quad \text{(16)}$$

where:

a

- is the total adhesion at the interface between the soil and structure.
4.5.2.3.7 In both drained and undrained analyses, the total pressure (p.) acting normal to the face of the structure should additionally satisfy:

$$\rho_{h}\geq \rho_{h,min}=\begin{cases}k_{min}z & \text{in the absence of water} \\ \gamma_{w}z & \text{in the presence of water}\end{cases}\tag{17}$$

where:

p<sub>h,min</sub> is the minimum total pressure to be assumed in the design;

kmin is a constant equal to 5 kPa/m;

- is the weight density of groundwater; and Vw
- is depth below ground surface. Z

NOTE The product kminz is traditionally known as the "minimum equivalent fluid pressure (MEFP)".

#### 4.5.2.4 Passive earth pressures

# COMMENTARY ON 4.5.2.4

Where an earth retaining structure moves towards the ground sufficiently for the earth pressure against it to reach its maximum value, the ground is said to be in a "passive" state. This condition is mainly relevant to ground located in front of the structure (i.e. the restraining ground).

4.5.2.4.1 In a drained analysis, when the earth retaining structure moves towards the ground, the effective earth pressure acting normal to the face of the structure (p' ) may be calculated from:

$${\cal P}^{\prime}_{\rm D}\leq{\cal P}^{\prime}_{\rm D}=K_{\rm D}{\cal P}^{\prime}_{\rm V}+K_{\rm D}c^{\prime}\tag{18}$$

where:

| p'p        | is the effective passive earth pressure acting normal to<br>the structure; |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| p'v        | is the effective overburden pressure in the ground;                        |
| c'         | is the soil's effective cohesion; and                                      |
| Kp and Kpc | are passive earth pressure coefficients.                                   |

4.5.2.4.2 Values of the passive earth pressure coefficient, K<sub>p</sub>, may be calculated from the analytical procedure given in BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, C.2.

4.5.2.4.3 For earth retaining structures with vertical faces, values of the passive earth pressure coefficient, K" may be estimated from the figures given in BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, C.1.

The formulae in BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, C.1, give similar values of K, to NOTE BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2014, C.2, except for large angles of shearing resistance and interface friction, when the values from C.2 are more conservative (see Eurocode 7 – a commentary [25]). The use of the figures in C.1 is not recommended for interface friction angles greater than two-thirds of the soil's angle of shearing resistance.

4.5.2.4.4 The value of Kg may be calculated from:

$$K_{pc} = 2\sqrt{K_p(1+a/c')} \le 2.56\sqrt{K_p} \tag{19}$$

where:

is the effective adhesion at the interface between the soil and a structure.

4.5.2.4.5 In an undrained analysis, when the earth retaining structure moves towards the ground, the the total pressure acting normal to the face of the structure (ρη) may be calculated from:

$$\rho_{n} \leq \rho_{p} = \rho_{v} + K_{pc,u}C_{u} \tag{20}$$

where:

p<sub>p</sub> is the total passive pressure acting normal to the structure;

pv is the total overburden pressure in the ground; pv

is the soil's undrained shear strength; and $c_u $

K<sub>pcu</sub> is an undrained passive earth pressure coefficient.

4.5.2.4.6 The value of $K_{pc,u}$ may be calculated from:

$$K_{pc,u} = 2\sqrt{1 + a/c_u} \le 2.56 \tag{21}$$

#### Compaction earth pressures in coarse soils and fill 4.5.2.5

### COMMENTARY ON 4.5.2.5

Earth retaining structures can retain coarse soils or engineered fill that is placed and compacted behind the wall. Compaction can lock in higher horizontal stresses in the retained soil or fill than are calculated assuming at rest or active conditions.

4.5.2.5.1 Compaction pressures and earth pressure due to live loading should not be applied simultaneously.

4.5.2.5.2 Filling adjacent to earth retaining structures should conform to BS 6031:2009, 7.6.10.

4.5.2.5.3 To prevent excessive horizontal forces on earth retaining structures, both the compaction plant and method of compaction used for filling adjacent to structures may differ from those used in general earthworks construction.

4.5.2.5.4 The effects of compaction behind an earth retaining structure should be considered in the calculation of bending moments and shear forces in the structure.

4.5.2.5.5 The horizontal effective stress in coarse soils and fill that are placed and compacted behind an earth retaining structure may be estimated from Figure 4 and the following expressions (see also The pressure of compacted fill on retaining walls [26]):

$$\sigma'_{h} = \begin{cases} \frac{\sigma'_{v}}{K_{0}} & \text{for } z \le z_{c} = K_{0} \sqrt{\frac{2P}{\pi \gamma}}\\ \sigma'_{h,comp} = \sqrt{\frac{2P\gamma}{\pi}} & \text{for } z_{c} \le z \le h_{c} \\ K_{0}\sigma'_{v} & \text{for } z \ge h_{c} = \frac{1}{K_{0}} \sqrt{\frac{2P}{\pi \gamma}} \end{cases} (22) $$

where:

| $σ'h$ and $σ'v$ | are the horizontal and vertical effective stresses<br>(respectively) at depth z below ground surface;                                                             |

#### Tension cracks 4.5.5

COMMENTARY ON 4.5.5

Where there is a low equilibrium groundwater table, tension cracks might form behind the retaining structure in a retained clay soil and extend over the full retained height of the wall.

4.5.5.1 Earth retaining structures in fine soils should be designed to withstand water pressures arising from fully- or partially-filled tension cracks that might form behind the wall.

NOTE The tension crack may be considered closed at the depth where total earth pressure in the ground exceeds the water pressure in the tension crack.

4.5.5.2 Allowance for the formation of a tension crack should be made by one or more of the following:

- re-assessing earth pressures acting over the depth of the tension crack on the basis of effective stress parameters, assuming the characteristic effective cohesion c' = 0;
- assuming a minimum total pressure on the wall in accordance with 4.5.2.3.7. ●

4.5.5.3 The depth of a tension crack may be limited to the retained height of the wall.

#### Ultimate limit states 4.6

#### General 4.6.1

4.6.1.1 The ultimate limit state design of an earth retaining structure should conform to BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 2.4.7, 9.2, and 9.7.

4.6.1.2 The overall stability of an earth retaining structure should be verified in accordance with BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 9.7.2.

#### 4.6.2 Design values of geotechnical parameters

### COMMENTARY ON 4.6.2

The UK National Annex to BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013 states that "it might be more appropriate to determine the design value of φ' "directly, rather than apply the partial factor » (= 1.25 for limit state GEO, Set M2) to its characteristic value".

4.6.2.1 In accordance with BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 2.4.5.2, the characteristic value of a geotechnical parameter should be selected as a cautious estimate of the value "affecting the occurrence of the limit state". The value of ø', may therefore be selected as a peak value, a constant volume value, a residual value or an intermediate value (as appropriate).

4.6.2.2 The design values of geotechnical parameters should conform to BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 2.4.6.2.

4.6.2.3 When the peak angle of shearing resistance is the value that affects the occurrence of the limit state, the design value of shearing resistance (ø' j) should either be assessed directly or obtained from:

$$\tan\varphi^{\\'}_{\rm d}=\frac{\tan\varphi^{\\'}_{\rm pk,k}}{\gamma_{\varphi}}\tag{23}$$

© The British Standards Institution 2015 · · 37

where:

- is the characteristic value of the soil's peak angle of shearing φ pk,k resistance; and
- is the partial factor specified in the UK National Annex to Vφ BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013.

4.6.2.4 If it is anticipated that there can be significant post-peak softening of the soil's shearing resistance, together with significant straining of the soil, then the peak angle of shearing resistance should not be selected as the value that affects the occurrence of the limit state.

4.6.2.5 When the constant volume anqle of shearing resistance is the value that affects the occurrence of the limit state, the design value of shearing resistance (ø' ) should either be assessed directly or obtained from:

$$
tan\varphi^{\\'}_{d} = \min \left\{ \begin{array}{l} \frac{\tan\varphi^{\\'}_{pk,k}}{\gamma_{\varphi}} \\\\ \frac{\tan\varphi^{\\'}_{cv,k}}{\gamma_{\varphi,cv}} \end{array} \right\} \tag{24}
$$

where:

| $φ'pk,k$ and $γφ$ | are as defined for equation (23);                                                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $φ'cv,k$          | is the characteristic value of the soil's constant volume<br>angle of shearing resistance; and |
| $γφ,cv$           | is a partial factor whose value is 1.0.                                                        |

4.6.2.6 When the residual angle of shearing resistance is the value that affects the occurrence of the limit state, the design value of shearing resistance (ø' ,) should either be assessed directly or obtained from:

$$\tan\varphi^{\\'}_{\rm d}=\min\left\{\begin{array}{l}\frac{\tan\varphi^{\\'}_{\rm pk,k}}{\gamma_{\varphi}}\\ \frac{\tan\varphi^{\\'}_{\rm res,k}}{\gamma_{\varphi,\rm res}}\end{array}\right\}\tag{25}$$

where:

$\varphi^{\prime}_{pk,k}$ and $\gamma_{\varphi}$ are as defined for equation (23);

  
$\varphi^{\prime}_{res,k}$ is the characteristic value of the soil's residual angle of shearing resistance; and

  
$\gamma_{\varphi,res}$ is a partial factor whose value is 1.0.

#### Minimum surcharge 4.6.3

COMMENTARY ON 4.6.3

It has been traditional in UK practice to apply a minimum surcharge of 10 kPa on the retained surface behind an earth retaining structure. This surcharge was intended to cater for unplanned additional loading from traffic, stored materials, goods, and containers, etc.

- """ "There is no requirement in BS EN 1997-1 for a minimum surcharge to be applied to earth retaining structures.
4.6.3.1 Design situations should take into account all imposed loads that are relevant to the areas over which they are likely to occur during the corresponding time period, as specified in BS EN 1991-1-1:2002, 6.3.

38 © The British Standards Institution 2015 .

4.6.3.2 The design surcharge, q,, acting over the surface of the retained ground should satisfy:

 
$$q_{d} \geq \begin{cases} \left(\frac{H_{d}}{H_{ref}}\right) \times q_{d,min} & \text{for } H_{d} < H_{ref} \\ q_{d,min} & \text{for } H_{d} \geq H_{ref} \end{cases} (26) $$
 

where:

- is the design value of the retained height of the earth retaining Ha structure;
- is a reference height, equal to 3 m; and Href
- is the minimum design surcharge, equal to 10 kPa. Qd,min

4.6.3.3 The value of qamin may be reduced when:

- the ground surface behind the retaining structure is subject to adequate ● engineering supervision throughout the design situation to prevent a surcharge greater than qamin being applied to it, and that supervision is specified in the Geotechnical Design Report (GDR) and in the extract from it that is provided to the client in accordance with BS EN 1997-1-1:2004+A1:2013, 2.8(6)P; or
- it is physically impossible for the retained surface to be subjected to ● surcharge loading greater than qamin during its design lifetime.

#### Unplanned excavation 4.6.4

### COMMENTARY ON 4.6.4

BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 9.3.2.2(2) recommends that the level of the soil in front of a retaining wall "should be lowered below the nominally expected level by an amount Δa", where Δa equals 10% of the retained height of the wall below its lowest support (if any), subject to a maximum of 0.5 m. This allowance, which BS EN 1997-1 specifies for "normal site control", is typically considered to provide for the effects of so-called "unplanned excavation" in front of the wall.

4.6.4.1 The value of Aa specified in BS EN 1997-1-1:2004+A1:2013, 9.3.2.2(2) may be reduced to zero when the surface level in front of the retaining wall:

- is subject to adequate engineering supervision throughout the design ● situation and that supervision is specified in the Geotechnical Design Report and in the extract from it that is provided to the client in accordance with BS EN 1997-1-1:2004+A1:2013, 2.8(6)P; or
- cannot deviate from its nominal level owing to the presence of structural elements (such as floor slabs or pavement).

4.6.4.2 Planned excavations should be considered in specific design situations, separately from any provision for unplanned excavations.

#### Serviceability limit states 4.7

### COMMENTARY ON 4.7

A serviceability limit state is a condition beyond which specific service requirements for the structure or foundation are no longer met. Serviceability requirements for earth retaining structures are commonly expressed as limiting criteria for wall deflection, settlement of the ground behind the structure, cracking in the retaining structure, or strain in nearby services and buildings.

4.7.1 The serviceability limit state design of an earth retaining structure should conform to BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 2.4.8, 9.2, and 9.8.

4.7.2 The terminology used to describe ground movements should conform to BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, Annex H(1) and Figure H.1.

4.7.3 Damage to masonry walls owing to ground movement should be classified in accordance with Behaviour of foundations and structures [N2] .

4.8.3 The structural design of steel earth retaining structures should conform to BS EN 1993.

4.8.4 The structural design of timber earth retaining structures should conform to BS EN 1995.

4.8.5 The structural design of masonry earth retaining structures should conform to BS EN 1996.

4.8.6 The shear stress in masonry retaining walls should be assessed in accordance with PD 6697:2010, 6.3.4.

4.8.7 The structural design of an earth retaining structure should take into account the likelihood that the most severe stresses in the structure might not occur when the structure is at an ultimate limit state of geotechnical failure.

4.8.8 The structure should be designed to withstand the largest stresses that it will encounter during the design situation.

4.11.3.2 If the design of an earth retaining structure relies on a dewatering system, a maintenance programme for dewatering should be specified.

#### Reporting 4.12

COMMENTARY ON 4.12

BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 2.8(1)P, requires the "assumptions, data, methods of calculation and result of the verification of safety and serviceability" to be recorded in the Geotechnical Design Report (GDR).

Additionally, BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 3.4.1(1)P, requires the results of a geotechnical investigation to be compiled in a Ground Investigation Report (GIR), which "shall form a part of the Geotechnical Design Report".

This standard extends this reporting regime to include a Geotechnical Feedback Report (GFR) that contains full records of the works constructed. These as-built records include information that will assist with future maintenance, design of additional works and decommissioning of the works. The GFR could also go some way to satisfying the requirements of CDM Regulations [4] with regards to preparation of a health and safety file.

None of these reports is the same as a qeotechnical baseline report, which mav be used on geotechnical projects for contractual purposes.

#### Ground Investigation Report 4.12.1

The Ground Investigation Report for an earth retaining structure should conform to BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 3.4.

#### Geotechnical Design Report 4.12.2

The Geotechnical Design Report for an earth retaining structure should conform to BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, 2.8.

#### 4.12.3 Geotechnical Feedback Report

COMMENTARY ON 4.12.3

The Geotechnical Feedback Report is also known as a "close-out report".

4.12.3.1 On completion of the works, a Geotechnical Feedback Report (GFR) should be prepared that covers the following broad classes of information:

- . a record of construction and any changes to its design; and
- results of monitoring and testing conducted during construction. .

4.12.3.2 The GFR should be tailored to suit the size and complexity of the works.

4.12.3.3 The record of construction should include, as appropriate:

42 © The British Standards Institution 2015 ●

- a general description of the works, including ground and groundwater conditions encountered;
- instability problems, unusual ground conditions and groundwater problems, including measures to overcome them;
- . contaminated and hazardous material encountered on site and the location of disposal, both on and off site;
- . temporary works and foundation treatment, including drainage measures and treatment of soft areas and their effectiveness;
- types of imported and site-won materials and their use; .
- any aspect of the specification or standards used that should be reviewed in view of problems encountered on site;
- any requirements for ongoing monitoring or abnormal maintenance requirements;
- any unexpected ground conditions that required changes to design; .
- problems not envisaged in the Geotechnical Design Report and the solutions ● to them; and
- as-built drawings.

4.12.3.4 The results of monitoring and testing should include:

- details of any in-situ testing;
- test logs and test results; ●
- summary of site laboratory testing;
- . location and details of instruments;
- readings from instruments (with dates) and predicted values;
- the results of compliance testing (e.g. in-situ density measurement, plate load tests); and
- data from monitoring instruments (e.g. piezometers, inclinometers, settlement gauges).

 The preparation of the GFR is particularly important where the NOTE 1 observational method of design has been used.

NOTE 2 Guidance on the preparation of close-out reports can be found in the ICE manual of geotechnical engineering (2012), Volume II, Chapter 101 [1].

### Gravity retaining walls 5

COMMENTARY ON Clause 5

This clause applies to the design and construction of:

- o mass concrete retaining walls;
- unreinforced masonry retaining walls;
- gabion walls; and
- . crib walls.

This clause does not cover the design and construction of reinforced concrete retaining walls (which are covered by Clause 6) or reinforced soil walls.

In the UK, gravity walls have been built up to 13 m in height. However, other solutions might be more economic when the height of ground to be retained is greater than 8 m.

#### Choice and design of gravity retaining walls 5.1

#### 5.1.1 General

5.1.1.1 The design of gravity retaining walls should conform to BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, Clause 9, and Clause 4 and Clause 5 of this standard.

5.1.1.2 The design of gravity walls in quay and jetty construction should conform to BS 6349-2:2010, Clause 7.

5.1.1.3 The design of reinforced soil walls should conform to BS 8006-1.

5.1.1.4 Where a gravity wall is combined with soil reinforcement, the design should conform to BS 8006-1.

5.1.1.5 The design of foundations for gravity retaining walls should conform to BS 8004.

5.1.1.6 Selection of a suitable type of gravity retaining wall should take into account:

- soil conditions;
- loads;
- drainage; ●
- . existing and proposed structures and roads;
- groundwater conditions;
- . the availability of space; and
- . the geometry of the structure.

5.1.1.7 Gravity retaining walls for maritime works should conform to BS 6349-2:2010, 7.3.

Guidance on the selection of a suitable gravity retaining wall can be found NOTE 1 in the ICE manual of geotechnical engineering (2012), Volume II, Chapter 62 [1] and in Earth Pressure and Earth-Retaining Structures, Chapter 6 [2].

Guidance on the selection of low-height modular retaining walls (including NOTE 2 unreinforced masonry, gabion, and crib walls) can be found in CIRIA Report C516, Chapter 3 [27].

#### Mass concrete retaining walls 5.1.2

COMMENTARY ON 5.1.2

Mass concrete retaining walls are suitable for retained heights typically up to 3 m. They can be designed satisfactorily for greater heights, but as the height increases other types of wall become more economic. The cross-sectional shape of the wall can be affected by factors other than stability, such as the use of the space in front of the wall, considerations of appearance or by the method of construction.

Figure 5 shows examples of typical mass concrete retaining walls.

The simple form is suitable for retained heights up to about 1.5 m.

Greater economy of material might be achieved if either the wall's front or back face is stepped or inclined.

Mass concrete retaining walls constructed under water for maritime works should conform to BS 6349-2:2010, 7.9.

#### Unreinforced masonry retaining walls 5.1.3

### COMMENTARY ON 5.1.3

Unreinforced masonry retaining walls are suitable for retained heights typically up to 1.5 m (in the case of a simple stem wall) or greater heights (in the case of stepped or buttressed walls). An advantage of masonry retaining walls is they require minimal construction plant.

"Dry-stack" masonry retaining walls typically consist of precast concrete blocks that interlock to form a wall with a solid face.

Figure 6 shows examples of typical unreinforced masonry retaining walls.

Concrete blockwork retaining walls for maritime works should conform to BS 6349-2:2010, 7.4.

#### Examples of unreinforced masonry retaining walls Figure 6

![](_page_51_Figure_3.jpeg)

#### Gabion walls 5.1.4

### COMMENTARY ON 5.1.4

Gabion walls are suitable for retained heights typically up to about 10 m. Gabions are large rectanqular cages or baskets, made of hexaqonal woven steel wire or square welded mesh, filled with stone. Gabions are used to build retaining walls, revetments, and anti-erosion works. Box gabions are normally available in half metre modules of length 2 m to 6 m, width 1 m to 2 m, and in depths of 0.3 m, 0.5 m, and 1 m.

The permeability and flexibility of qabions make them suitable where the retained ground is likely to be saturated and the underlying ground's bearing resistance is low.

Gabions cages can bulge and deform under load, particularly if they have not been filled correctly, and this might affect the serviceability of the structure and the use of the ground it is retaining. Welded gabions are commonly supplied with an increased diameter wire mesh to the front face to stiffen the structure and provide more support.

Figure 7 shows examples of typical gabion retaining walls.

Further information about gabion walls can be found in CIRIA Report C516 [27] and in Earth Pressure and Earth-Retaining Structures (3rd edition) [2].

#### Crib walls 5.1.5

### COMMENTARY ON 5.1.5

Crib walls are suitable for retained heights typically up to about 12 m. They are built with individual units, made of timber or precast concrete, that, when assembled, create a series of box-like structures into which suitable free draining coarse fill is

- placed. The fill acts in conjunction with the cribwork to support the retained ground.
Crib walls are flexible, open-faced structures that can accommodate differential settlement and movement caused, for example, by seasonal moisture changes.

46 © The British Standards Institution 2015 ●

# BS 8002:2015

The depth of the crib units is chosen to suit the overall height of the crib wall and the actions imposed upon it. In some design situations (including those with large retained heights, high loadings or weak soils), units of different depths are used.

Crib walls are normally built with a 1 (horizontal) to 4 (vertical) batter. However, this can vary to suit design requirements and the available space on site. Crib walls are formed with front and rear stretchers that are tied together with headers having notches or rebates.

A precast concrete crib wall uses less concrete than an equivalent mass concrete wall.

Figure 8 shows examples of typical crib walls.

Crib walls may be constructed of timber or precast concrete units.

NOTE Further information about crib walls can be found in CIRIA Report C516 [27] and in Earth Pressure and Earth-Retaining Structures [2].

#### Actions and design situations 5.2

5.2.1 Actions for gravity retaining walls should conform to 4.5.1.

5.2.2 Design situations for gravity retaining walls should conform to 4.2.2.

#### Design considerations 5.3

#### General 5.3.1

To avoid the illusion of tilting forward, the front face of a mass concrete retaining wall should be battered backwards at no less than 1 in 50.

#### Drainage 5.3.2

# COMMENTARY ON 5.3.2

The provision of a drainage system behind a gravity wall can reduce the total pressures that the wall has to resist possibly by more than 30% in granular material.

Figure 9 shows some typical drainage systems behind a gravity retaining wall.

Pipes used in drainage systems behind gravity retaining walls should conform to Table 10.

#### Gabion walls 5.3.3

5.3.3.1 The width of the horizontal tread of the steps should not exceed the depth of the gabion.

5.3.3.2 A gabion wall should be built to a batter to increase its resistance to overturning and sliding.

5.3.3.3 Counterforts or buttresses may be incorporated in the construction of gabion walls.

5.3.3.4 In large walls where the cross section is greater than 4 m wide, consideration should be given to using a cellular form of construction.

5.3.3.5 The outer and inner gabion faces should be tied by bulkheads of gabions and the cells between them filled with stone. The size and shape of the cells should be proportioned to achieve internal stability.

5.3.3.6 In rivers and in tidal waters, consideration should be given to installing a filter behind the wall, to prevent the leaching of fines.

5.3.3.7 Gabion boxes with cages longer than 1.5 m should be fitted with transverse vertical diaphraqm panels at 1 m centres to prevent undue distortion and stone migration. The edges of any diaphragm panels should be fixed to the sides by lacing or clips with 2.2 mm minimum binding wire, galvanized or PVC coated, to match the gabion mesh.

5.3.3.8 Gabion units should bear down fully on the gabion below and not overhang the unit at the back by more than 150 mm, except in the case of a stepped revetment. Where gabion units do overhang, care should be taken to compact the backfill in the vicinity of and beneath the overhang.

5.3.3.9 Traffic loads may be ignored in the verification of wall stability if they are a distance greater than the wall's retained height behind the back of the wall.

5.3.3.10 Gabion walls may be designed to support traffic loads, provided the wall's flexibility is taken into account.

5.3.3.11 Gabion walls intended to support an existing slope should be built into the slope, after suitable trimming.

5.3.3.12 Foundations for buildings or other structures should not impose loading onto a gabion wall or its foundation.

#### Crib walls 5.3.4

5.3.4.1 The batter of a crib wall should normally be between 1-in-6 and 1-in-4 (horizontal to vertical).

5.3.4.2 A crib wall retaining up to 2 m of soil may be built with a nominal batter (i.e. near vertical) if its depth is greater than its retained height.

5.3.4.3 Timber crib walls may be built using whole logs or sawn timbers. If whole logs are used, plane faces should be formed at the points of contact to distribute the load and provide anchorage between adjacent members.

5.3.4.4 Timber crib walls should be formed with front and rear stretcher units tied at intervals by headers across the thickness of the wall. Headers should be anchored by notching or spikes so as to tie together the stretcher courses.

5.3.4.5 The face stretchers of a precast reinforced concrete crib wall should be positively anchored over the full thickness of the wall by interlocking headers. The headers should be aligned vertically to transmit load directly throughout the height of the wall without inducing bending moments in the supporting i stretcher units.

5.3.4.6 Traffic loads may be ignored in the verification of wall stability if they are a distance greater than the wall's retained height behind the back of the wall.

5.3.4.7 Crib walls may be designed to support traffic loads, provided the wall's flexibility is taken into account.

5.3.4.8 Crib walls intended to support an existing slope should be built into the slope, after suitable trimming.

5.3.4.9 Foundations for buildings or other structures should not impose loading onto a crib wall or its foundation.

5.3.4.10 Weepholes should be provided if the infill is not free draining (for example if lean mix concrete infill has been used to increase stability). The infill zone immediately behind the wall should be built with free-draining material.

#### Calculation models 5.4

#### Virtual back of wall 5.4.1

Gravity retaining walls that do not have a planar back surface may be designed with a planar "virtual back", where the virtual back is:

- for a gravity wall with a stepped back: the vertical plane extending from the heel of the wall base to ground surface;
- for a crib wall: along the back of the cribs; and
- for a gabion wall: along a line from the inner bottom corner of the lowest o basket to the inner top corner of the top basket.

#### Interface friction between wall and ground 5.4.2

# COMMENTARY ON 5.4.2

In gabion walls, separation of the backfill stone and the retained soil is normally achieved by placing a geotextile membrane along the rear face of the wall. The presence of this membrane can reduce interface friction along the rear face.

5.4.2.1 Owing to their surface roughness, the design angle of interface friction, S between the rear of a gabion wall and the retained ground should be limited to:

$$\delta_{d} \leq K_{membrane} \times \varphi_{d}^{'} \tag{27}$$

where:

| $\phi'_d$      | is the design peak angle of shearing resistance of the<br>ground; and                                                                               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $k_{membrane}$ | is a factor that accounts for the reduction of friction<br>caused by the presence of a membrane placed against<br>the rear face of the gabion wall. |

5.4.2.2 For geotextile membranes, in the absence of reliable test data, the value of kmembrane should be taken as 0.75 where the rear face of the wall is planar; otherwise it may be taken as 1.0. For other types of membrane, kmembrane should be determined from test data.

#### Cribwalls 5.9.4

5.9.4.1 Units should be designed for the maximum loading condition at the base of the wall, so that all the units can be of the same size throughout the wall.

5.9.4.2 Units should be detailed and manufactured to provide plane bearing surfaces that are sufficiently large to prevent crushing failure from the loading involved. Due allowance should be made for any reduction in bearing area owing to manufacturing and erection tolerances.

5.9.4.3 Header units should be designed as beams over their unsupported length, to carry a load equal to the weight of the superimposed fill with maximum consolidation.

5.9.4.4 Stretchers should be designed to resist bending caused by the horizontal component of the earth pressure behind the cribwall, together with pressures induced by compaction of the fill.

5.9.4.5 The connection between the headers and stretchers should be designed to resist the reactions from the stretchers mainly by mechanical interlock, which is normally provided by using recesses or dowels.

5.9.4.6 The structural design of the headers and stretchers of a crib wall should consider:

- o headers and stretchers spanning between joints, considered both as simply supported and with fixed ends;

5.10.2.3 Vertical construction joints should be at approximately 10 m centres and should coincide with contraction or expansion joints.

5.10.2.4 Where a wall is subject to hydrostatic pressures, hydrostatic uplift should be taken into account at construction joints. Horizontal construction joints should be designed to be watertight wherever possible, but if they cannot be watertight, the design should cater for full hydrostatic uplift.

NOTE 1 Guidance on the design and construction of joints in concrete structures can be found in CIRIA Report R146D [28].

#### Unreinforced masonry retaining walls 5.10.3

The execution of unreinforced masonry retaining walls should conform to BS EN 1996-2 and PD 6687.

#### Gabions walls 5.10.4

5.10.4.1 Gabions made of welded wire mesh should be electrically welded at every intersection, giving a minimum average weld shear strength of 70% of the minimum ultimate tensile strength of the wire.

5.10.4.2 When gabions are constructed on site from rolls or sheets of mesh, care should be taken to prevent rupture of the outer surface of the mesh (which can lead to progressive failure of the gabion).

5.10.4.3 Empty cages may be placed singly or joined together in groups. Woven wire mesh gabions should be stretched with a small winch before being wired to adjacent units that have already been filled. The tension should be maintained until the units are filled. Underwater gabions should be pre-filled before they are placed.

5.10.4.4 Cages should be tightly filled with some overfilling to allow for subsequent settlement. The top layer of stone may be of a smaller size than is used elsewhere in the cage. When filled, the qabion lids should be properly closed, without gaps, and wired down. Horizontal internal bracing wires should be fitted between the outer and inner faces at 330 mm centres in both woven mesh and welded mesh qabions which are deeper than 500 mm. When filled, the gabion lids should be properly closed without gaps, and wired down.

5.10.4.5 Horizontal internal bracing wires should be fitted between the outer and inner faces of the caqe in both woven mesh and welded mesh gabions that are vertically deeper than 500 mm.

5.10.4.6 The vertical joints between individual units may be staggered in adjacent courses, to give a better appearance and to prevent the formation of weak vertical shear planes. Curves and angles in the face of the structure may be formed by cutting and folding the wire mesh to make specially shaped units.

5.10.4.7 Where qabions are subjected to wave action, there should be a minimal amount of movement of the stone filling inside the baskets. The filling should be tightly packed and the wire mesh should be taut. Baskets should be opened after a few tides have passed through the work and stone added to make good any settlement that has occurred in the filling. Any loose stone left over after construction should be removed and not left on the foreshore.

#### 5.10.5 Crib walls

5.10.5.1 Where the infill material to a crib wall has a different grading to the backfill material, the rear wall drainage pipe should be pre-wrapped with a suitable geotextile prior to installation.

5.10.5.2 Where the ground's bearing resistance is adequate, the crib wall may be erected without a separate concrete foundation. It should be built off header units set on a granular bed.

5.10.5.3 The first row of headers should be positioned to line and level on the prepared foundation and held in place by the interlocking stretcher units; the batter should be checked. On sloping ground the foundation should be stepped to follow the slope, the steps being spaced to suit the unit module lengths.

#### Reinforced concrete retaining walls/stem walls 6.1.2

COMMENTARY ON 6.1.2

Reinforced concrete retaining walls are suitable for retained heights typically up to about 8 m; for greater heights, a counterfort or buttress is normally needed to prevent the wall's stem becoming uneconomically thick.

Reinforced concrete retaining walls may be cast-in-place or precast in a factory. Precast walls are available in standard sizes up to 4 m high.

The main types of reinforced concrete retaining walls are:

- . cantilever or stem walls (also known as "T-shaped" walls);
- reverse cantilever walls (also known as "L-shaped" walls);
- . counterfort walls;
- o buttressed walls.

Buttressed reinforced concrete retaining walls are seldom used.

Figure 11 shows examples of typical reinforced concrete walls.

Precast reinforced concrete retaining walls for maritime works should conform to BS 6349-2:2010, 7.5.

#### Reinforced and prestressed masonry retaining walls 6.1.3

# COMMENTARY ON 6.1.3

Reinforced masonry retaining walls are suitable for retained heights typically up to about 3 m; prestressed masonry retaining walls are suitable typically up to about 5 m. Masonry walls benefit from a good appearance and good weathering capability.

Prestressed masonry has greater resistance to lateral loading owing to its increased flexural tensile capacity compared to non-prestressed masonry.

The main types of reinforced masonry retaining walls are of:

- grouted cavity construction;
- quetta-bond construction;
- pocket-type construction; or
- . hollow blockwork construction.

#### Sheet pile walls 7.1.2

# COMMENTARY ON 7.1.2

Sheet pile walls are constructed by driving, vibrating or pressing sheet piles into the ground without any material being removed. They are traditionally installed using hammers, which can cause a significant noise and vibration. In recent years, installation using pre-augering in dense coarse soil and press-in systems in fine soils have become more prevalent in urban environments, to overcome noise and vibration hazards.

#### Steel sheet pile walls 7.1.2.1

7.1.2.1.1 Hot rolled steel sheet piles should be manufactured in accordance with BS EN 10248.

7.1.2.1.2 Cold formed steel sheet piles should be manufactured in accordance with BS EN 10249.

- 7.1.2.2 Timber sheet pile walls
#### 7.1.2.3 Precast concrete sheet pile walls

#### Bored cast-in-place concrete pile walls 7.1.3

COMMENTARY ON 7.1.3

There are two main arrangements of bored cast-in-place concrete pile walls:

- "contiguous" (or "close bored"), which are built with piles at centres slightly ● qreater than their diameter; and
- o "secant", which are built with piles at centres less than their diameter (alternate piles are full circular section and intervening piles are cut away in part during construction).

Bored cast-in-place concrete piles may be constructed in supported or unsupported borings that are created by rotary drilling or continuous flight auger (CFA) equipment.

Unless special measures are taken to provide a seal between adjacent piles, contiguous pile walls should not be used to retain water-bearing granular soils.

Secant pile walls can provide a watertight retaining wall provided the NOTE tolerances of position and verticality are sufficient to eliminate gaps between adjacent piles.

#### Diaphragm walls 7.1.4

Diaphragm retaining walls for maritime works should conform to BS 6349-2:2010, 7.11.

Diaphragm walls are formed from interlocking reinforced concrete panels NOTE that may be cast-in-place or precast.

#### Soldier/king pile walls 7.1.5

COMMENTARY ON 7.1.5

Soldier/king pile walls comprise isolated posts that are installed along the line of the wall with the ground between the posts being supported by railway sleepers, concrete panels, wooden or steel sheeting, or cast-in-place or spray concrete.

King piles (or "posts") are also called "solder piles".

King pile walls are also known as "Berlin walls".

The lagging between adjacent soldier/king piles may be horizontal or vertical (as shown in Figure 15).

#### Actions and design situations 7.2

7.2.1 Actions for embedded retaining walls should conform to 4.5.1.

7.2.2 Design situations for embedded retaining walls should conform to 4.2.2.

#### Design considerations 7.3

#### 7.3.1 General

# COMMENTARY ON 7.3.1

The use of flexible cantilever retaining walls (such as sheet pile walls) is typically acceptable up to a maximum retained height of about 5 m, depending on ground conditions. Where soft or loose soils occur in front of the wall, this maximum retained height might need to be reduced significantly.

The use of stiff cantilever retaining walls (such as diaphragm walls) can be acceptable up to a maximum retained height of about 8 m, depending on the design situation.

The use of very stiff cantilever retaining walls (such as combined and high-modulus cantilever steel sheet pile walls and composite diaphraqm walls) can be acceptable up to a maximum retained height of about 12 m, depending on the design situation.

Where services are located behind embedded retaining walls (particularly cantilever walls), the effect of wall deflection on these services should be considered.

72 © The British Standards Institution 2015 .

#### Soldier/king pile walls 7.3.2

7.3.2.1 Piles may be of reinforced concrete or steel sections used either singly or in pairs.

7.3.2.2 Where steel sections are used, they may be set into bored concrete piles below the depth of excavation.

7.3.2.3 Where steel sections are used in pairs to form soldier piles, adequate batten plates or spacers should be provided to ensure the composite action of both piles, as shown in Figure 16.

![](_page_78_Figure_7.jpeg)

7.3.2.4 The ground between individual soldier piles should be supported by horizontal sheets, which should be fabricated from:

- reinforced or prestressed precast concrete planks; .
- . cast-in-place concrete planks or sprayed concrete;
- . steel trench sheets; or
- timber lagging. ●

NOTE 1 Unreinforced precast concrete planks might exhibit brittle failure without visible or audible warning.

Guidance on suitable thicknesses of rough-cut timber lagging can be found NOTE 2 in the ICE manual of geotechnical engineering (2012), Volume II, Chapter 85 [1].

NOTE 3 The most common material for supporting the ground is timber lagging.

#### Waling beams 7.3.3

7.3.3.1 Where props or anchors are used to support an embedded retaining wall at various levels, waling beams should be provided along the face of the wall at these support levels.

7.3.3.2 Waling beams may be designed as horizontally spanning beams.

7.3.3.3 Where steel beams are used, a satisfactory method of wedging or infilling should be provided between individual piles and the waling beam, to take up gaps that occur because of surface irregularities or deviations from true verticality and position of individual piles.

#### Capping beams 7.3.4

A continuous structural beam should be used to connect pile heads together, thereby unifying their behaviour as an earth retaining wall and in order to distribute any vertical load which might also be applied.

#### Calculation models 7.4

### COMMENTARY ON 7.4

Embedded retaining walls may be designed using a variety of calculation models, including:

- the limiting equilibrium method;
- discrete spring models; or
- o continuum models.

Discrete spring and continuum models are commonly termed "soil-structure interaction" (SSI) analyses.

NOTE Guidance on calculation models for the design of embedded retaining walls can be found in CIRIA Report C580 [N3] and Earth Pressure and Earth-Retaining Structures (3rd edition), Chapters 8 and 10 [2].

#### Limiting equilibrium method 7.4.1

### COMMENTARY ON 7.4.1

The limiting equilibrium method (LEM) is a traditional method of retaininq wall design that has been used successfully to design mainly cantilever and propped-cantilever (i.e. single-propped) retaining walls.

In the LEM, the ground surrounding the embedded retaining wall is assumed to be in a state of collapse, with its strength fully mobilized on both sides of the wall. The wall itself is assumed to be about to rotate as a rigid body about a fixed point, which, in the case of cantilever wall, is determined from the analysis and lies below formation level; or, in the case of a propped-cantilever wall, is coincident with the location of the prop or support.

The LEM can be used to determine the ultimate limit state of cantilever and propped-cantilever embedded retaining walls, but not their serviceability limit state. For propped-cantilever walls, a more efficient design might be achieved using a method that takes account of ground-structure interaction or a method of stress-redistribution.

7.4.1.1 The limiting equilibrium method may be used to determine the required depth of embedment of a cantilever or propped-cantilever (i.e. single-propped) embedded retaining wall, and the resulting bending moments and shear forces in it.

NOTE Further information about the limiting equilibrium method can be found in Earth Pressure and Earth-Retaining Structures (3rd edition), Chapter 8.5 [2] and in CIRIA Report C580 [N3].

7.4.1.2 The bending moments and prop forces that are calculated for propped-cantilever (i.e. single-propped) embedded retaining walls by the limiting equilibrium method may be adjusted for relative wall-soil stiffness using the methods presented by Rowe [30] or Potts and Bond [31].

#### 7.4.2 Discrete spring models

### COMMENTARY ON 7.4.2

A discrete spring model is a type of soil-structure interaction analysis, in which the ground is modelled by discrete springs and the wall by a continuous beam, thereby allowing a traditional beam-on-spring analysis to be performed.

There are two main forms of discrete spring model: one involving linear-elastic ("Winkler") springs with no interaction between them; the other involving non-linear ("intelligent") springs with interaction. In both cases, earth pressures are limited by their active and passive values. Winkler spring models are also known as "subgrade reaction" models. Intelligent spring models are also known as "pseudo finite element" models.

74 © The British Standards Institution 2015 Discerete spring models can be used to determine both the ultimate and serviceability limit states of embedded retaining walls.

7.4.2.1 Discrete spring models may be used to determine the required depth of embedment and horizontal displacement of an embedded retaining wall, and the resulting bending moments and shear forces in it.

7.4.2.2 Discrete spring models used for embedded retaining wall design should take into account both the stiffness of the ground and limiting earth pressures.

NOTE Further information about discrete spring models can be found in Earth Pressure and Earth-Retaining Structures (3rd edition), Chapter 8.6 [2] and in CIRIA Report C580 [N3].

#### Continuum models 7.4.3

COMMENTARY ON 7.4.3

A continuum model is a type of soil-structure interaction analysis, in which the ground and the wall are modelled by individual elements that have different engineering properties throughout the domain of the problem. The analysis is performed numerically to bring the wall into equilibrium under the applied loads, while ensuring strain compatibility between the wall and the ground.

Continuum models include techniques such as:

- the finite element method;
- . the boundary element method; and
- . the finite difference method.

Continuum models can be used to determine both the ultimate and serviceability limit states of an embedded retaining wall.

Continuum models may be used to determine the required depth of embedment and horizontal displacement of an embedded retaining wall, and the resulting bending moments and shear forces in it.

Further information about continuum models can be found in the book NOTE Earth Pressure and Earth-Retaining Structures (3rd edition), Chapter 8.7 [2] and in CIRIA Report C580 [N3].

#### 7.4.4 Successive stage analysis

COMMENTARY ON 7.4.4

The limiting equilibrium method (LEM) can be extended to include the design of multi-propped embedded retaining walls using a technique known as "successive stage analysis" (see Figure 17). In this method, hinges are introduced into the wall at the levels of the props so that two separate calculations can be performed, one a simple beam analysis of the upper part of the wall and the other a propped-cantilever analysis of the bottom part of the wall.

Successive stage analysis is also known as the "hinge" method.

A successive stage analysis can be used to determine the ultimate limit state of multi-propped embedded retaining walls, but not their serviceability limit state.

Successive stage analysis may be used to determine the required depth of embedment of a multi-propped embedded retaining wall, and the resulting bending moments and shear forces in it.

NOTE Further information about successive stage analysis can be found in the Piling Handbook (8th Edition) [32] and CIRIA Special Publication 95 [33]

#### Equivalent anchor method 7.4.5

### COMMENTARY ON 7.4.5

The equivalent anchor method can be used to determine the ultimate limit state of embedded walls supported by two props or anchors, but not their serviceability limit state.

The equivalent anchor method (see Wall design [34]) may be used to determine the required depth of embedment of an embedded retaining wall with two levels of support, and the resulting bending moments and shear forces in it.

#### Distributed prop load method 7.4.6

# COMMENTARY ON 7.4.6

The design of propping to support embedded retaining walls next to deep excavations has traditionally been based on prop loads determined from "apparent earth pressure" diagrams that were first proposed by Peck [35]. These diagrams are also commonly known as "Peck's envelopes". An updated version of Peck's method, in which the term "distributed prop load" is preferred to "apparent earth pressure", was proposed by CIRIA C517 [36].

The distributed prop load method (see CIRIA C517 [36]) may be used to determine the loads in temporary propping to an embedded retaining wall.

NOTE Further information about the distributed prop load method can be found in CIRIA C517 [36] and Earth Pressure and Earth-Retaining Structures (3rd edition), Section 10.4.1 [2].

### COMMENTARY ON 7.7.5

The forces generated in props, struts and anchors do not necessarily reach their maximum values when an earth retaining structure reaches an ultimate limit state. Particularly with stiff earth retaining systems, the maximum force in the support might occur when the structure reaches (or even before it reaches) a serviceability limit state. --',,,'''''''''''''',,'',,''''','-'',,' ... '',,' '',,' '',,' '',, '--

7.7.5.1 The design axial resistance of a prop, strut, or anchor that is used to support an earth retaining structure should be at least equal to a design axial force (Fg) given by:

$$F_{d} = \max\begin{cases} F_{Ed,ULS} = \gamma_{sd} \times P_{d,ULS} \\ \gamma_{F} \times F_{Ed,SLS} = \gamma_{F} \times \gamma_{sd} \times P_{d,SLS} \end{cases} (29)$$

where:

- is the design force (effect) in the support at the ultimate limit FEd,ULS state:
- is the design force (effect) in the support at the serviceability FEd,SLS limit state;
- is the axial force (i.e. reaction), calculated using ultimate limit Pauls state (ULS) design parameters, that is required to prevent the earth retaining structure exceeding an ultimate limit state; and
- is the axial force (i.e. reaction), calculated using serviceability Pa,sırs

limit state (SLS) design parameters that is required to prevent the earth retaining structure exceeding a serviceability limit state; and

- is a model factor for load-effects. Vsd

### 00 Cofferdams, basements, and strutted excavations

COMMENTARY ON Clause 8

This clause applies to the design and construction of:

- . cofferdams;
- . basements;
- strutted excavations; and ●
- buried concrete structures.

NOTE 1 Guidance on the design of basements can be found in SCI Publication P275 [37], the Concrete Centre's guide to concrete basements [38], IStructE's report on deep basements [39], and CIRIA Report 139 [40].

 Attention is drawn to The Construction (Design and Management) NOTE 2 Regulations 2015 [4], with regards to health and safety requirements for construction works, in particular Requlation 23 which deals with cofferdams.

#### Choice and design of structure 8.1

#### 8.1.1 General

8.1.1.1 The design of cofferdams, basements, and strutted excavations should conform to BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, Clause 9, and Clause 4 and Clause 8 of this standard.

8.1.1.2 The design of buried concrete structures should conform to PD 6694-1:2011, Clause 10, and Clause 4 and Clause 8 of this standard.

8.1.1.3 Protection of below ground structures against water from the ground should conform to BS 8102.

8.1.1.4 The design and construction of anchors used to support basement retaining walls should conform to BS 8081.

#### Cofferdams 8.1.2

8.1.2.1 The design of cofferdams should conform to 8.1.1.1 and BS 6349.

NOTE Guidance on the design and construction of sheet-piled cofferdams can be found in CIRIA Special publication 95 [33].

8.1.2.2 The choice of a suitable cofferdam type should consider:

- whether a land or water cofferdam is required;
- the nature of the permanent structure to be built within the cofferdam;
- plan dimensions of the working area required inside the cofferdam;
- total depth of soil and/or water to be retained;
- soil conditions below and above foundation level; ●
- groundwater levels and their fluctuation and, for water cofferdams, the ● tidal, seasonal, and flood levels;

82 © The British Standards Institution 2015 .

- for water cofferdams, the strength of the current, wave action and scour before, during and after construction;
- possible effects of cofferdam construction on existing buildings or other structures close to it;
- availability of materials;
- . methods of constructing and dismantling the cofferdam;
- . time available for construction of the cofferdam;
- . noise, vibration, fumes and fire risk;
- . relative total costs of the cofferdams where two or more types are otherwise suitable; and
- accessibility, especially for cofferdams in water.

NOTE The function of a cofferdam is to provide working space for the execution of permanent works below water level. A cofferdam is typically a temporary structure, all or part of which is removed after construction.

#### Single-wall cofferdams 8.1.2.3

COMMENTARY ON 8.1.2.3

A single-wall (also known as "single-skin") cofferdam is usually supported either internally, by bracing within the cofferdam, or externally, by anchors around its perimeter.

8.1.2.3.1 Single-wall cofferdams may be constructed using:

- o flexible walls, such as steel sheet pile walls; or
- o diaphraqm walls.

8.1.2.3.2 Sheet piling used to form a cofferdam should be capable of being driven to the depths required.

8.1.2.3.3 Sheet pile sections should be chosen so that they do not suffer mechanical damage during installation.

8.1.2.3.4 Steel sheet pile walls used to construct single-wall cofferdams should be designed in accordance with Clause 7.

8.1.2.3.5 Diaphragm walls used to construct single-wall cofferdams should be designed in accordance with Clause 7.

Guidance on the design of single skin cofferdams can be found in the Piling NOTE Handbook, Section 9.4 [32].

#### Double-wall cofferdams 8.1.2.4

### COMMENTARY ON 8.1.2.4

A double-wall (also known as "double-skin") cofferdam is a self-supported gravity structure, formed by two parallel lines of sheet piling connected together by a system of walings and tie rods at one or more levels. The space between the walls is normally filled with coarse or very coarse soil, such as sand, gravel, or broken rock. Cellular cofferdams are also "double-walled", but are treated as a separate type of cofferdam in this standard.

Double-wall sheet pile cofferdams for maritime works should conform to BS 6349-2:2010, 7.8.

Guidance on the design of double skin wall cofferdams can be found in the NOTE Piling Handbook, Section 9.10 [32].

#### 8.1.2.5 Cellular cofferdams

### COMMENTARY ON 8.1.2.5

A cellular cofferdam is a self-supported gravity structure, constructed from straight web steel sheet piles to form cells of various shapes. The cells are normally filled with coarse or very coarse soil, such as sand, gravel or broken rock. Cellular cofferdams shared many similarities to double-wall cofferdams. The stability of a cellular cofferdam depends upon the tensile strength of the sheet piling (especially the clutches), properties of the fill,the shape and size of the cells, and the foundation materials. Outward pressure from the fill is resisted by high circumferential tensile forces in the straight web piles.

Cellular sheet pile cofferdams for maritime works should conform to BS 6349-2:2010, 7.7.

NOTE Guidance on the design of cellular cofferdams can be found in the Piling Handbook, Chapter 10 [32].

#### 8.1.3 Basements

The design of basements should conform to 8.1.1.1 and BS 8102.

#### Deadman anchors Annex A

(normative)

# COMMENTARY ON Annex A

Anchors for retaining walls are of three general types:

- ground anchors (including rock and soil anchors);
- . tension piles; and
- . deadman anchors.

This annex applies to the design and construction of deadman anchors comprising:

- . continuous walls (made of steel or concrete);
- . mass concrete blocks; and
- . friction slabs.

This annex does not apply to the design and construction of grouted (also known as qround) anchors or tension piles.

#### General A.1

A.1.1 The design of deadman anchors should conform to BS EN 1997-1:2004+A1:2013, Clause 9, and Clause 4 of this standard and this annex.

A.1.2 The design of grouted anchors should conform to BS 8081.

A.1.3 The design of tension piles should conform to BS 8004.

#### Choice of structure A.2

NOTE See Figure A.1 for types of deadman anchor.

#### A.2.1 General

A.2.1.1 The choice of a suitable deadman anchor should take into account:

- the suitability of the proposed installation technique for the prevailing ground conditions;
- their possible effect on adjoining buildings; and
- . the rights of adjoining owners under whose building or land the anchors are to be inserted.

NOTE 1 Deadman anchors may be continuous or comprise a series of separate units.

NOTE 2 Continuous walls may be constructed using steel sheet piles, cast-in-place reinforced concrete or precast reinforced concrete.

A.2.1.2 Continuous walls should be provided with suitable drainage measures to prevent differential hydrostatic pressures acting on them.

#### Continuous walls made of steel or concrete A.2.2

### COMMENTARY ON A.2.2

Continuous walls provide resistance to horizontal movement of the supported structure by mobilizing passive earth pressure in front of the wall. These walls require a waling to distribute anchor tie forces to the ground.

#### Mass concrete blocks A.2.3

# COMMENTARY ON A.2.3

Mass concrete blocks provide resistance to horizontal movement of the supported structure partly through friction at their base and partly by mobilizing passive earth pressure in front of the block. They are generally less efficient than continuous walls in providing horizontal resistance and are used mainly where tie forces are not very large.

#### Friction slabs A.2.4

# COMMENTARY ON A.2.4

Friction slabs, which may be buried or at ground surface, provide resistance to horizontal movement of the supported structure mainly through friction along their base. They are generally less efficient than walls in providing horizontal resistance and are used mainly where tie forces are not very large.

### Specific formations Annex B (informative)

#### London clay B.1

London Clay was deposited in marine conditions in the Eocene epoch (30 million years ago). London Clay is made up of various silty clay and sandy clayev silt units, separated by glaucontic rich horizons. Very fine sand and silt dustings, partings and lenses are frequent in the siltier clays, and sand layers occur in the sandy clayey silts. Phosphatic and claystone nodules are quite common throughout the deposit.

The London Clay in central London is one of the most highly investigated soils in the world.

NOTE A summary of the characteristics of London Clay can be found in Some characteristics of London Clay [41] and The London Clay at T5 [42].

#### Gault Clay B.2

The Gault Clay comprises a sequence of clays, mudstones, and thin siltstones with bands of phosphatic nodules of Middle and Upper Albian age. It outcrops in East Anglia, Wessex, Dorset, North East Kent, Surrey and Hampshire.

Gault Clay causes a number of serious geotechnical problems, including ancient and recent landslides, and can contain sufficient sulfate and sulfuric acid for potential chemical attack on concrete. Seasonal shrinkage and swelling of this highly expansive soil can result in damage to buildings.

Guidance on the engineering geology of Gault Clay can be found in BGS NOTE Technical Report WN/94/31, Engineering Geology of British Rocks and Soils – Gault clay [43].

#### Lambeth Group B.3

The Lambeth Group (previously known as the Woolwich and Reading Beds) is a complex sequence of gravels, sands and clays that vary considerably both horizontally and vertically and whose properties range between those of an enqineering soil and a rock. The Lambeth Group underlies much of south-east Enqland, particularly in London and Hampshire, and, as a result, is frequently encountered in major construction projects. CIRIA identified the Lambeth group as one of the "economically important UK soils and rocks" (CIRIA C583 [44]).

NOTE 1 Guidance on the engineering properties of the Lambeth Group can be found in CIRIA C583 [44].

Guidance on the engineering geology of the Lambeth Group can be found NOTE 2 in BGS Open Report OR/13/006, Engineering Geology of British Rocks and Soils -Lambeth Group [45].

#### Glacial soils and tills B.4

Glacial deposits are widespread throughout the world and are frequently encountered in the upland parts of the United Kingdom. Glacial tills and soil are amongst the most difficult to engineer, owing to their marked variation in both thickness and engineering properties.

NOTE 1 Guidance on the classification of glacial tills can be found in Chapter 4 of CIRIA C504 [46].

NOTE 2 Guidance on the engineering properties of glacial tills can be found in Chapter 5 of CIRIA C504 [46].

NOTE 3 Information about issues relevant to glacial soils can be found in the ICE manual of geotechnical engineering (2012), Volume I, Chapter 31 [3].

#### Problematic soils B.5

B.5.1 Problematic soils include materials that display significant volume change, a distinct lack of strength, or are potentially corrosive. Problematic soils are profoundly influenced by the climatic reqime in which they were developed. (See ICE manual of geotechnical engineering, Volume II [1] for further information).

B.5.2 Problematic soils include (but are not limited to); arid soils, tropical soils. glacial soils, alluvial soils, collapsible soils, expansive soils, non-engineered fills, organics/peat soils, sulfate/acid soils, and soluble ground.

Information about problematic soils and their issues can be found in the NOTE 1 ICE manual of geotechnical engineering (2012), Volume I, Section 3 [3].

Information about shrinkable (also known as expansive) soils can be found NOTE 2 in the ICE manual of geotechnical engineering (2012), Volume I, Chapter 33 [3].

#### Chalk B.6

Chalk forms the downland of southern England, the Wolds of eastern England, and the white cliffs of Antrim, East Yorkshire, Dover, and from the Seven Sister to Dorset. The chalk is the UK's most important aquifer for potable water supply. A great deal of construction and infrastructure development is built on chalk.

Guidance on the description and classification of chalk can be found in NOTE 1 CIRIA C574, Chapter 3 [47].

NOTE 2 Guidance on the mechanical properties of chalk can be found in CIRIA C574, Chapter 4 [47].

#### Mercia Mudstone Group B.7

The Mercia Mudstone Group of rocks underlies much of northern, central and southern England and parts of Northern Ireland. The engineering properties of the rocks and the derived soils are important as they are frequenctly encountered in excavations and as founding strata.

NOTE 1 Guidance on the description and classification of Mercia mudstone can be found in CIRIA C570, Section 2, Geological background [48].

Guidance on the engineering properties of Mercia mudstone can be found NOTE 2 in CIRIA C570, Section 5, Correlation of engineering properties to the SPT and Section 6, In-situ properties and behaviour of Mercia mudstone [48].

90 © The British Standards Institution 2015 ●

Guidance on the engineering geology of Mercia mudstone can be found in NOTE 3 BGS Report RR/01/02, Engineering geology of British rocks and soils: Mudstones of the Mercia Mudstone Group [49].

#### Lias Group B.8

The Lias Group encompasses an important group of geological materials, comprising clay-rich mudstones interlayered with limestones. The outcrop of the Lias extends in a continuous band from the coast of Dorset in a north-north-easterly direction to Yorkshire, with outlying areas in Somerset and South Wales.

NOTE Guidance on the engineering geology of the Lias Group can be found in BGS Internal Report OR/12/032, Engineering Geology of British Rocks and Soils – Lias Group [50].
